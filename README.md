# Web-Based Facial Authentication System

## Overview
This project is a real-time *Web-Based Facial Authentication System* built using *Python, **OpenCV, and the **face_recognition* library. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and compares them to a set of known faces to authenticate users.

The system can be extended for various real-world applications such as:
- Exam proctoring
- Meeting attendance verification
- Law enforcement identification
- Secure access control (e.g., phone unlocking)

---

## Features
- Real-time webcam-based face detection and recognition
- Easy to add new known users (just drop their images in a folder)
- User-friendly display with authentication labels
- Modular code for extensibility

## Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python
- *Libraries:*
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - for camera handling and face drawing
  - [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) - for encoding and face matching
  - NumPy - used internally for array manipulation
  - Flask (optional) - for a potential web UI layer
